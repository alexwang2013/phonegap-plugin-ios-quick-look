The Phonegap Quick Look plugin provides a way to open documents, images and text files (e.g. iWorks, PDF, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PNG, JPEG, rich text, CSV) directly from your iOS application (e.g. iPhone or iPad). The plugin uses the Quick Look functionality of iOS (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/DocumentInteraction_TopicsForIOS/Articles/UsingtheQuickLookFramework.html). The user doesn't need a program for that specific file format. The framework also supports 'forwarding' the file to any other application on the device that supports that file format.
